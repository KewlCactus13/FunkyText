# Simple html Pong :>
IMPORTANT: this is very wip and i do NOT think it is actively the best it could be

my pong is a simple html pong game made by ME, open the itch link to play it from there (very simple)
please dont be rude, this is one of my first times actually using html outside of school so i might be bad

the only base additions from the regular pong that you could find anywhere and everywhere are:
1. visual improvements
2. More features (no new stuff added YET)
3. simplicity, meaning no funky 3rd party websites, no weird downloads, just an in-browser pong :>

enjoy! -kewlcactus13 A.K.A Isaac
